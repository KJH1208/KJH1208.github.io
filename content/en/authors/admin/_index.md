Hello, I’m Juhyeon Kang. I’m studying Computer Engineering at Jeonbuk National University, and I’m particularly interested in backend development, system security, and DevOps automation.
In this semester’s project, I built a personal portfolio website using the HugoBlox template and GitHub Actions, implementing multilingual support (Korean/English) and an automated deployment pipeline.

	•	Major / Interests: Networks & Systems, Security, Data Pipelines, Static Site Automation
	•	Tools Used: Git, GitHub Actions, HugoBlox, Markdown
	•	Goal: Establish a reusable portfolio and project presentation layout applicable to real-world development

{{< icon name="download" pack="fas" >}} {{< staticref "uploads/resume.pdf" "newtab" >}}Download{{< /staticref >}} my resumé as a PDF.
